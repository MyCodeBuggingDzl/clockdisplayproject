It is discussed in chapter 3.

This project adds a simple GUI (graphical user interface) to the 
clock display project. When the clock is run, it runs at approximately
3 minutes per second, so that the display can be tested a little more 
easily. The speed can be increased by clicking the 'Start' button 
repeatedly.

Project: clock-display-with-GUI
Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes 

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 3.

This project adds a simple GUI (graphical user interface) to the 
clock display project. When the clock is run, it runs at approximately
3 minutes per second, so that the display can be tested a little more 
easily. The speed can be increased by clicking the 'Start' button 
repeatedly.


Questions Part 2:

21: It's set to that time because it's the initial value.
23: you have do call it 60 times to reach 1:00
25:     
     Rectangle window;
         Rectangle window = new Rectangle window(2,5);
26: Whenever you call timeTick the displays update (+1 minute for every tick) once reach 60 minutes, it'll turn to 1 hour and repeats.
27: The first constructor doesn't have any parameters (difference), they both have hours and minutes and because the second constructor could have been set by a value.
28:
 private Printer;
public void print(String filename, boolean doubleSided)
public int getStatus(int delay)
printf("printing", true);
printf("unable to print", false);
29: Wall, window, roof and sun.
30: roof.changeSize(60, 180);
            roof.moveHorizontal(20);
            roof.moveVertical(-60);
            roof.makeVisible();
31: Yes, it contains some internal method calls.
32: 2
33: The remainder will be negative.
34: 0-4
35: If positive it should be above 0 other wise smaller than 0.
37: The first one because it's much easier to display the time.
